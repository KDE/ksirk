(nothing)

but, this stuff couldn't hurt:
  fields that need to be an explicit size should use int16_t, etc
  support for other DNS record types (SOA, NSPTR)
  detect CNAME loops, rather than looping max times in order to fail
  don't follow CNAME for SRV (or so I'm told?)
  if it is not possible to implement DNSSEC outside of jdns, then add the
    minimal number of hooks to jdns so that it becomes possible
  use hash tables to speed up the list lookups
  unit tests
  qjdns debug lines reworking:
    init should emit debugLinesReady, and debug should be available
      immediately after call (the emit will break SS/DS, put a note about
      this in a comment about init())
    anywhere else, debugLines should conform to SS, but be emitted at the
      proper time, not deferred.  currently, the debug arrives out of
      sequence with the other signals, resulting in strange output in the
      commandline tool.
    consideration for these changes in jdnsshared
