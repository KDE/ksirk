Before KDE4.0:
  * max size of the window limited by the map size

Quickly
  * replace all QMessageBox by KMessageBox
  * [DONE] study the replacement of the global timer by more local ones

Before 1.9:
  * [DONE] finish porting to KDE4
  * [DONE] port to QGraphicsView + SVG (maybe even for 2.0)
  * [DONE] zoom
  * add something similar to cards in Risk(R)
  * add more visual clues during battle (number of cannons and explosions equal
    to those involved, the nation flag, etc.)
  * rework overall window presentation (size of maps, chat and info dialog, etc.)
  * [DONE through chat and info widget] at first game launch, add an information step explaining the role of buttons
    with a "Do not show again" check box.
  * [DONE] show opponent countries during battle
  * handle plurals in messages
  * [DONE through chat and info widget] clearly show the battle results (graphics)
  * enhance the new AI (make it aware of goals,...)
  * [DONE] automaticaly choose the messages window lines height depending on the font
  * replace ids by names in the skins onu.xml file format and make the countries
    vector independent of the order in the ONU class
  * make players order random at initialization
  * [DONE] possibility to save AI only games

Before 2.0:
  - if a fight starts outside of the displayed zone, automaticaly move to 
    center on the fight (configurable)
  - possibility to Drag and Drop the map
  - perfect implementation of Risk rules (optional if some enhancements are
    implemented) ;
  - [DONE] hability to save game at any point
  - use khotnewstuff for new skins
  - use GGZ or Jabber to offer or find network games

Middle to long term:
  - game periods (distribution of armies, attacks, ...) should be simultaneous
    for all the players. But keep a turn-by-turn organization (partly-real-time) ;
  - map  = 3D model, map = earth or other planet; could be zoomed and rotated.
    sprites = flat images or (better) 3D models too.

Ideas by Dre to be dispatched :
 (3) [DONE] show the results of the dice rolled 
 (4) [DONE] make it clearer who lost what in a battle
 (1) [DONE] The animation is 
      too slow
 (6) [DONE] let me pick the number of armies to 
      attack with using the keys - 1, 2, 3 - clicking takes too long if you are
      doing a repeat battle
 (5) [To be done for 1.9] I would initiate an attack by clicking on the attack 
      armies and then when you drag you drag a canon with you to the target 
      country - this dovetails nicely
with opint (1), b/c then you don't have to slowly move the cannon afterwards
 (2) [To be done for 2.0 ?] Color-code the countries by the owner - the flags are 
      too hard to identify
 (7) [To be done for 2.0 or before] have a "battle until troops exhausted" option - 
      sometimes you just want a country no matter what the cost, but a cancel 
      button would be useful too (in this case it would be nice if a dialog 
      popped up with the two countries enlarged and the battle raging and 
      soldiers falling in each round - hey, it's a wishlist,
  I can dream, no ;-) ?


Previous Releases

  - [There was still a lot :-(] bugs correction.

Before 1.2 :
  01- [Not so urgent] review API documentation ;
  02- [DONE] stop the timer when the windows looses the focus ;
  03- [DONE] implement basic AI ;

      hiding to "graying" ;
  09- [DONE] change the gestion of "multiple-territories countries": generalize
      Each country should be composed of a number of separated territories with
      a centralized gestion by extension, use the "mask solution" for the map.
  10- [DONE] Change the remaining "hard-wired" sizes (sprites sizes in 
      computations etc.) in the code and use the configuration file instead
  11- [DONE] click or hit space to finish a move immediatly ;
  12- [DONE] option to change sprites speed : from
      slow to immediate

Before 1.4 :
  - [DONE] implements goals ;
  - [DONE] make possible the changement of map : all map-related data should be

  - [DONE] KDE standard config management
  - [DONE] option to change sprites speed : from slow to immediate
  - [DONE] option to enable or disable sounds
  - [DONE] add a central point different of the flag point to countries to reduce

    time and not hard coded on the map image
