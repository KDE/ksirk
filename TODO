Before 2.0:
  - [DONE, Toulouse 2008 students, configuration option missing] if a fight
    starts outside of the displayed zone, automaticaly move to center on the
    fight (configurable)
  - possibility to Drag and Drop the map
  - perfect implementation of Risk rules (optional if some enhancements are
    implemented) ;
  - [DONE] hability to save game at any point
  - [DONE] use khotnewstuff for new skins
  - use GGZ or Jabber to offer or find network games

Middle to long term:
  - game periods (distribution of armies, attacks, ...) should be simultaneous
    for all the players. But keep a turn-by-turn organization (partly-real-time) ;
  - map  = 3D model, map = earth or other planet; could be zoomed and rotated.
    sprites = flat images or (better) 3D models too.

Ideas by Dre to be dispatched :
 (3) [DONE] show the results of the dice rolled 
 (4) [DONE] make it clearer who lost what in a battle
 (1) [DONE] The animation is 
      too slow
 (6) [DONE] let me pick the number of armies to 
      attack with using the keys - 1, 2, 3 - clicking takes too long if you are
      doing a repeat battle
 (5) [To be done for 1.9] I would initiate an attack by clicking on the attack 
      armies and then when you drag you drag a canon with you to the target 
      country - this dovetails nicely
with opint (1), b/c then you don't have to slowly move the cannon afterwards
 (2) [To be done for 2.0 ?] Color-code the countries by the owner - the flags are 
      too hard to identify
 (7) [DONE] have a "battle until troops exhausted" option -
      sometimes you just want a country no matter what the cost, but a cancel 
      button would be useful too (in this case it would be nice if a dialog 
      popped up with the two countries enlarged and the battle raging and 
      soldiers falling in each round - hey, it's a wishlist,
  I can dream, no ;-) ?
