    * removed button "Next player" when computer distributes its armies between two
      turns

    * The computer places armies in countries that have some ennemy neighbours and
      not entirely at random

      one. Also, this new algorithm is independent of the number of countries,

    * Added a continent class. It is a first step towards the implementation of a

    * Added a Nationality class. Will be used to put a player flag in the status
      bar and to add some choices to the users (name, flag, etc.)

      has its own file and the canvas do not need to be subclassed

      to all movements that would be shorter by the side, on x and y axis. Ready for

      window gets back the focus.
