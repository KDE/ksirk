<!-- Abstract about this handbook -->

<abstract>
<para>
&ksirk; is a computerized version of a well known strategy game. Commercial
and other Free Software versions exist but I (Gaël de Chalendar) created this game
initially as a C++ learning exercise and so, I developed it up to this point (see README for details).
</para>
<para>
In the current version, &ksirk; is a multi-player network-enabled game with an AI.
(see TODO for details)
</para>
<para>
This documentation gives the major information you need to start playing.
Please read the tooltips and the status bar messages to complete your information. A chapter explains how to create new skins for &ksirk;
</para>
<para>
The goal of the game is simply to conquer the World... It is done by attacking your neighbors
with your armies. Peaceful, isn't it :-)

each chapter so with the id attribute. This is necessary for two reasons: it
allows you to easily reference the chapter from other chapters of your

from time to time making it hard to manage for maintainers and for the CVS
system. Any chapter labeled (OPTIONAL) may be left out at the author's
discretion. Other chapters should not be left out in order to maintain a
consistent documentation style across all KDE apps. -->

<para>
At the beginning of the game, countries are distributed to all the players. Each country contains
one army (represented by an infantryman) at the start. Each player has some armies to
distribute to his countries at their turn (indicated by the presence of their name and their flag in
the status bar). Note that five armies are represented by a cavalryman and 10 by
a cannon.
</para>
<para>
To put an army on one of your countries, click on it with the left mouse button. To remove an
army, click with the right button. Note, as a general rule, that you will never be able to remove
more armies than the number you placed.

    each one. The values of the bonuses for the default skin are:

<title>Sending messages to other players</title>
<para>
If you play a local game and want to communicate with the other players, well, let's speak (supposing you have no accessibility problems)... But if you are playing a network game, you can use the chat frame at the bottom of the window (it can be hidden or showed using the arrows). Just type in your message and hit &Enter;.

    Please refer to <ulink url="http://api.kde.org/">http://api.kde.org/</ulink> for the documentation of the API. It was quite complete but is currently a little bit outdated. There are no comments in the <filename>.cpp</filename> implementation files.

  <para>
    Note that I originally developed this game under &Windows; with Borland C++ and WinG. I ported
    it to &Java; before converting back to C++ and &kde;. At the beginning I used French or a mix of
    French and English to name the identifiers (classnames, methods, members, &etc;). I also used French for the comments. When I decided to distribute this game, I decided to convert all to english... but I am clearly not a native English speaker: please suggest or make and submit corrections, to the code comments or to this documentation

    &ksirk; comes with a skin editor, named ksirkskineditor(!), that allows to edit all skin data, as soon as graphics (map, sprites, &etc;) are available in a SVG file. Please see the ksirkskineditor manual for further details.
